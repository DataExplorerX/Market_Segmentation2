# Market Segmentation for Online Vehicle Booking App

Welcome to the Market Segmentation module of innovative Online Vehicle Booking App! This repository contains the code necessary to perform market segmentation, a crucial component of our app's success.

## Overview

Market segmentation is the process of dividing the potential user base of our online vehicle booking app into distinct groups based on specific characteristics, preferences, and behavior. By understanding the diverse needs and preferences of different customer segments, we can tailor our app's offerings, marketing strategies, and user experience to effectively target and engage each group.

## Key Features

1. **Data Collection:** This module includes scripts to gather and preprocess data from the Kaggle dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Before performing segmentation, we recognize the importance of clean and consistent data. This repository contains tools to preprocess and cleanse the data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.

3. **Market Segmentation Techniques:** Our team has implemented state-of-the-art market segmentation algorithms, including but not limited to:
   - **Demographic Segmentation:** Dividing users based on age, gender, location, and other demographic factors.
   - **Behavioral Segmentation:** Grouping users by their booking frequency, average spend, preferred vehicle types, etc.
   - **Psychographic Segmentation:** Analyzing users' lifestyle, preferences, and interests to understand their motivations.
   - **Geographic Segmentation:** Segmenting users based on their geographical locations and preferences.
   - **Cohort Analysis:** Studying user behavior within specific time frames to identify trends and patterns.

4. **Visualization and Reporting:** We have incorporated various data visualization tools to help comprehend the segmented groups effectively. The results are presented through insightful graphs, charts, and tables. Additionally, we offer automated reporting to facilitate decision-making processes.

5. **Recommendation Engine Integration:** Once the market segments are identified, the output of this module will be given to the client, tailoring vehicle options and promotions to cater to each segment's unique needs.
